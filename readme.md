(In collaboration with P. Orlando)

These files are part of my research on the urban heat island effect. Our goal
is to use surface temperature data collected by satellites and ambient
temperature data collected by PSU at ground level to determine how accurate the
satellite data - the basis of heat island studies to date - actually is, and
whether its errors correlate with particular features of the urban landscape.

This code covers the process of clipping the Landsat surface temperature data to the study regions and reprojecting the result to match the ambient temperature data. Surface.html is online [here](http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/jalt/surface.html).
